# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenHamClock will be documented in this file.

## [15.0.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **N0NBH Band Conditions** — Real-time band condition data from N0NBH's NOAA-sourced feed replaces the old calculated estimates. Server-side `/api/n0nbh` endpoint with 1-hour caching. Day/night conditions per band, VHF conditions (Aurora, E-skip by region), geomagnetic field status, signal noise level, and MUF. PropagationPanel shows mini day/night indicators when conditions differ between day and night
- **User Profiles** — Save and load named configuration profiles from Settings → Profiles tab. Each profile snapshots all localStorage keys (config, layout, filters, map layers, preferences). Supports save, load, rename, delete, export to JSON file, and import from file. Useful for multi-operator shared stations or switching between personal views (contest mode, field day, everyday)
- **Concurrent User Tracking** — Health dashboard (`/api/health`) now shows real-time concurrent users, peak concurrent count, session duration analytics (avg/median/p90/max), duration distribution buckets, and an active users table with anonymized IPs and session durations
- **Auto-Refresh on Update** — New `useVersionCheck` hook polls `/api/version` every 60 seconds. When a new version is detected after deployment, connected browsers show a toast notification and automatically reload after 3 seconds. Lightweight `/api/version` endpoint with no-cache headers
- **Cloud Layer Restriction** — OWM cloud overlay restricted to local installs only via `localOnly` flag in layer registry. Cloud layer invisible on openhamclock.com, visible on localhost/LAN
- **A-Index Display** — A-index and geomagnetic field status added to Header and ClassicLayout solar stats bars, color-coded by severity
- **Space Weather Extras** — Header shows A-index (color-coded: green <10, amber 10-19, red ≥20) and geomagnetic field status from N0NBH data

### Changed
- **Band Conditions Rewrite** — `useBandConditions` hook completely rewritten. Removed 200+ lines of local SFI/K-index formula calculations. Now fetches from `/api/n0nbh` server proxy and maps N0NBH grouped ranges (80m-40m, 30m-20m, etc.) to individual bands
- **Health Dashboard Auto-Refresh** — HTML health dashboard now auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Stats Grid** — Health dashboard shows 6 stat cards (added Online Now and Peak Concurrent)
- **Donate Buttons** — Hidden in fullscreen mode across Header, ModernLayout, and ClassicLayout
- **CI Pipeline** — Dropped Node 18 (replaced with 20.x/22.x), replaced `npm start` with `node server.js` to skip redundant prestart build, added retry loop for health check (up to 30 attempts), same retry pattern for Docker health check
- **Version** — Bumped to 15.0.0

### Fixed
- **CI Health Check Failure** — `npm start` was running `prestart` (full rebuild) before starting the server, causing the 5-second `sleep` + `curl` to fail every time. Now uses `node server.js` directly since the build step already ran

## [3.12.0] - 2025-02-03

### Added
- **State persistence** — All user preferences survive page refresh: PSK/WSJT-X panel mode, TX/RX tab, solar image wavelength, weather panel expanded state, temperature unit
- **Collapsible weather** — DE location weather section collapses to one-line summary, expands for full details
- **Lunar phase display** — 4th cycling mode in Solar panel shows current moon phase with SVG rendering, illumination %, and next full/new moon dates
- **F°/C° toggle** — Switch temperature units with localStorage persistence; header always shows both
- **Satellite filtering** — Complete satellite filter interface in Settings → Satellites tab. Select/deselect from 40+ satellites, real-time visibility status, persistent filters
- **WSPR heatmap improvements** — Increased brightness (opacity 0.75-1.0), 4-layer glow effect, tighter clustering (radius 50,000m → 6,000m), adjustable opacity slider
- **DX Target enhancements** — Distance calculation (Haversine), beam headings (SP/LP), color-coded display
- **Lightning detection** — WebSocket server fallback system, proximity alerts, RBN history management
- **WSPR data quality** — Spot limit increased from 2,000 to 10,000, detailed marker tooltips with power/SNR/distance/efficiency

### Fixed
- **PSKReporter MQTT** — Field mapping used `sa`/`ra` (ADIF country codes) instead of `sc`/`rc` (callsigns), so no MQTT spots ever matched
- **PSKReporter RX topic** — Subscription pattern had one extra wildcard
- **PSKReporter HTTP fallback** — If MQTT fails within 12 seconds, automatically falls back to HTTP API
- **Map layer persistence** — Map style/zoom save was overwriting plugin layer settings. Now merges correctly
- **Version consistency** — All version numbers now read from package.json as single source of truth
- **PSKReporter 403 spam** — Server backs off for 30 minutes on 403/429 responses
- **WSPR heatmap infinite loop** — Removed heatmapLayer from useEffect dependencies
- **WSPR grid filter** — Supports 2-6 character grids, prefix matching (FN → FN03, FN21)
- **WSPR callsign filter** — Proper suffix stripping (VE3TOS/M → VE3TOS), respects grid filter state
- **Satellite initialization** — Fixed ReferenceError when filteredSatellites referenced satellites.data before hook initialized
- **VOACAP ionosonde label** — Added "Iono:" prefix to clarify it's the data source, not the DX location

### Changed
- **WSPR update frequency** — Polling interval from 5 minutes to 60 seconds
- **WSPR band chart** — Removed pulsing animation, added smooth CSS transition

### Reverted
- **WSPR MQTT** — Real-time MQTT feed attempted and reverted due to mixed content policy (HTTPS pages cannot connect to insecure WebSocket)

## [3.11.0] - 2025-02-02

### Added
- **PSKReporter Integration** — New panel showing stations hearing you (TX) and stations you're hearing (RX). Supports FT8, FT4, JS8, and other digital modes. Configurable time window. Signal paths drawn on map
- **Bandwidth Optimization** — Reduced network egress by ~85%: GZIP compression, server-side caching, reduced polling intervals, HTTP Cache-Control headers

### Fixed
- Empty ITURHFPROP_URL causing "Only absolute URLs supported" error
- Satellite TLE fetch timeout errors handled silently
- Reduced console log spam for network errors

## [3.10.0] - 2025-02-02

### Added

- **Auto-build on start** — `npm start` automatically builds React frontend
- **Update script** — `./scripts/update.sh` for easy local/Pi updates
- **Network access configuration** — `HOST=0.0.0.0` for LAN access
- **Grid locator auto-conversion** — Calculates lat/lon from LOCATOR
- **Setup wizard** — Settings panel auto-opens if callsign or locator missing
- **Retro theme** — 90s Windows style
- **Classic layout** — Original HamClock-style with black background and large colored numbers

### Changed
- Configuration priority: localStorage > .env > defaults
- DX Spider connection uses dxspider.co.uk as primary

### Fixed
