To use this program, simply enter CTYHDG. You will be given instructions.

This program will convert the files CQWW.CTY WAE.CTY and ARRL.CTY that are
shipped with K1EA's CT program, and will convert the file 0NA.CTY that is
shipped with K8CC's NA program, to include a little extra information in them.

If you use CT or NA, you probably already know the F10 key will tell you what
country a callsign belongs to.  This information comes from the .CTY files.
You may make your own beam heading support by altering these files.  For
example, you can change:

Spratly Island:           26:   1S:     1S;

to ...

Spratly Island (303):     26:   1S:     1S;

The result is that next time you enter a call starting with 1S and you hit
F10, you not only see Spratly Island on the screen, but also the beam heading.
The only problem is that the file is only good for your location, and it takes
a long time to update all the files.

This is where CTYHDG comes in.  This program contains will update your .CTY
files with the beam information from whatever latitude and longitude that you
like.  You will not reduce the available number of QSO's that are available to
you in either the CT or NA programs.  Not a bad feature for no loss of memory.

If a new country is assigned in the future, you may want to add the country
and prefix into both the CTYHDG.PRE file and the .CTY files.  In these files,
use the format shown.  In the CTYHDG.PRE file, do not go past column 26 for
the country description.  Also note that if a prefix shows up twice in this
file, only the first one is used.  The country description in this file is
only used if the original .CTY file contains a country description that goes
past column 21 (as of version 2.00 of CTYHDG), otherwise the country
description in the .CTY file is used. If you only update the .CTY file and not
the CTYHDG.PRE file, don't worry, the program will not destroy your .CTY file.
You will be informed of the prefix that was not found, and the original prefix
is transfered with no beam heading information.

HISTORY:
******
On Nov. 20, 1990, I have released CTYHDG version 2.00 with the following
enhancements:

1. The program will now take the country description from the original
   .CTY file, rather than from the CTYHDG.PRE file supplied with this program,
   with the exception of when the original description goes past column 21.
   In this case, the modified country description doesn't fit, and therefore
   the country description in CTYHDG.PRE is used.

2. To allow modification of a file that has previously been updated by CTYHDG,
   the program checks the country description for a '(' character followed by
   any 3 characters, and then ends with the two characters '):'.  This
   combination of charcters is unlikely to be used in any other way within
   the country description, but be aware that a description such as
   GERMANY (GDR): would not work, as the program would change this to
   GERMANY (033): rather than GERMANY (GDR) (033):

3. The CTYHDG.PRE file now contains file update instructions.

On Nov. 28, 1990 I released CTYHDG version 2.01. This version fixes a problem
that shows up with (01e) instead of (100) if the actual calculation was
between 99.96 and 99.99.
******
On Dec. 28, 1990 I released CTYHDG version 3.00 with the following changes:

1. Added support for K8CC's NA program.

2. This version fixes a problem with the prefixes VK, BY, W, UA0 and VE.
   These countries cover more than one zone, and CT will calculate the actual
   zone based on the full prefix entered. An example is, VE6 is zone 4, VE7 is
   zone 3. In CT version 6.22 or older, any beam information added to these
   prefixes prevents this feature from working. This version has the /O option
   which will ignore these prefixes so the zone calculation will work for
   older versions of CT.

3. The program is now simpler to run. The old .CTY file is now copied into a
   .OLD file, and the original .CTY file is changed. No more manual copying.
******
Version 3.01 was only an upgrade to the CTYHDG.PRE file
******
Version 3.02 was only an upgrade to the CTYHDG.PRE file
******
On July 25, 1991, I upgraded to call VE7VT from VE7CQD. This version 3.03
reflects these changes.
